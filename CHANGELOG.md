## [0.11.0](https://github.com/ekino/MarkdownViewer/releases/tag/v0.11.0) - 2026-07-03

### Added

- Native File and View menus matching standard macOS apps: File (Open File… ⌘O, Open Folder… ⇧⌘O, Open Recent ▸, Print… ⌘P, Export as PDF… ⇧⌘S, Close Window) and View (Toggle Dark Mode)
- Open Recent submenu, dynamically populated from the last 10 opened documents (deduped, most-recent-first), recorded on top-level opens (picker, file association, CLI, restore)
- In-memory document cache keyed by path + mtime so re-opening a document is instant, without serving stale content after an external edit
- Loading spinner (shown after a 150ms delay to avoid flashing on fast reads) and a one-time dismissible notice when an uncached read exceeds 600ms, explaining the likely cloud-sync cause (FR + EN)
- Debug HUD (⌘/Ctrl+Shift+D) showing live FPS and per-phase document-open timings (ipc, read, parse, images, mermaid, dom, outline, total) with click-to-copy

### Changed

- Documents are read through a dedicated async Rust command (`read_document`, confined to home/resource dirs with canonicalization) instead of the fs plugin, keeping slow reads off the UI thread — fixes multi-second freezes when opening cloud-synced (e.g. OneDrive on-demand) files

### Fixed

- Stop lingering search highlights when switching documents (reset now reads the live input value) and when clearing the last character (1→0) on the WKWebView CSS Custom Highlight path

## [0.10.0](https://github.com/ekino/MarkdownViewer/releases/tag/v0.10.0) - 2026-07-01

### Added

- Native Preferences window opened from the menu bar (MarkdownViewer › Preferences…, ⌘,) organized in General, Fonts and Appearance tabs
- General tab: interface language (French / English, auto-detected from the system locale on first launch) and outline panel visibility (Auto / Always / Hidden)
- Fonts tab: document text size presets (Small / Medium / Large) plus advanced typography (body/code font pickers from installed system fonts, weight, exact pixel size, one-click reset)
- Appearance tab: 8 predefined themes (Light, Dark, GitHub, Dracula, Solarized Light/Dark, Nord, Sepia) shown as preview tiles, "Follow system" light/dark pairing, and an in-app visual theme editor with live preview
- Create, duplicate, edit, import (JSON) and reveal-in-Finder for custom themes, stored as JSON in the app support directory and reloaded at startup
- Full French / English translations applied via `data-i18n` attributes with English fallback
- Native macOS Edit menu (Undo, Redo, Cut, Copy, Paste, Select All) so system editing shortcuts work in text inputs, plus a Find item (⌘F) that focuses the search field

### Changed

- Destructive theme-deletion confirmation uses a styled in-app modal instead of the native blocking `confirm()`
- Closing Preferences resets transient state (active tab, editor, scroll) so each reopen lands on a clean view

### Fixed

- Dragging the custom title bar now moves the window (granted `core:window:allow-start-dragging`), matching native macOS behavior
- Clearing the search (including the native `<input type="search">` clear button in WKWebView) now removes stale highlights immediately, cancelling any pending debounced query

### Accessibility

- Native focus trap on every modal (Preferences, theme editor, image lightbox, mermaid fullscreen, confirm dialog) with Tab / Shift+Tab cycling, Escape to close and focus restoration
- Preferences tabs follow the ARIA tabs pattern (roving focus, Left/Right/Home/End, `aria-selected` kept in sync)

## [0.9.0](https://github.com/ekino/MarkdownViewer/releases/tag/v0.9.0) - 2026-05-09

### Added

- In-document full-text search bar in a new custom title bar (macOS Overlay style, native traffic lights preserved)
- Accent-insensitive search by default, with case-sensitive and whole-word toggles via an options popover
- Cmd+F focuses the search input, Cmd+G / Shift+Cmd+G navigate matches, Esc clears the query
- Open files directly by double-clicking them in Finder

### Changed

- PDF, Print and Theme buttons moved from the sidebar header to the new title bar
- Title bar reserves the traffic-lights area via `env(titlebar-area-x)` instead of a hardcoded 80px offset
- Use a buffered pending-open slot for cold-start file association (no more 500ms timing hack); on hot-start, emit directly without re-buffering

### Fixed

- Search popover closes with Escape and exposes `aria-haspopup` / `aria-expanded` for assistive tech
- Search navigation (next/prev) updates only the current-match highlight instead of rebuilding all highlights
