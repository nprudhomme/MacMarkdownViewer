# Footnotes

Footnotes allow you to add references without cluttering the main text.

## Basic Footnotes

This is a sentence with a footnote[^1]. And here is another one[^2].

You can also use named footnotes for better readability[^named].

## Multiple References

The same footnote can be referenced multiple times. For instance, this point is important[^1] and so is this related one[^2].

## Footnotes with Rich Content

Some footnotes can contain more detailed explanations[^detailed].

Mathematical concepts often need footnotes for clarification[^math].

## Inline Usage

Here are footnotes used naturally in a paragraph. The Rust programming language[^rust] was created by Graydon Hoare at Mozilla Research. It focuses on safety, speed, and concurrency[^concurrency]. The first stable release was Rust 1.0[^release].

---

[^1]: This is the first footnote. It provides additional context.
[^2]: This is the second footnote with a [link](https://example.com).
[^named]: Named footnotes make the source markdown more readable.
[^detailed]: This footnote contains **bold text**, *italics*, and even `inline code`. It demonstrates that footnotes support full markdown formatting.
[^math]: In mathematics, a footnote might reference a theorem like the Pythagorean theorem: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.
[^rust]: Rust is a systems programming language focused on memory safety.
[^concurrency]: Concurrency in Rust is achieved through ownership and type-checking.
[^release]: Released on May 15, 2015.
